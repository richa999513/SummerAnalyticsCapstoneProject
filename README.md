# ðŸš— Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

**Capstone Project - Summer Analytics 2025**  
hosted by the Consulting & Analytics Club Ã— Pathway

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Urban parking spaces in crowded cities face issues of under-utilization or overcrowding due to static pricing policies. To address this, our project develops an **intelligent dynamic pricing engine** that updates parking fees in real time based on factors like demand, queue length, traffic congestion, special events, vehicle type, and competitor prices.  

The project supports **14 parking lots** and uses historical + live streaming data to optimize pricing strategies. Three progressively sophisticated models were developed:  

- **Model 1 (Baseline Linear)**: price based on current occupancy  
- **Model 2 (Demand-Based)**: considers occupancy, queue, traffic, special days, and vehicle type  
- **Model 3 (Competitive)**: adds competitor pricing and geographic proximity

Pricing updates are visualized in real time using Bokeh, streamed using Pathway-like simulated pipelines, and built fully from scratch with only pandas, numpy, and Pathway.
